# Arc Stack Ops Runbook

Records host-level changes that live outside git (redis.conf, fstab, sysctl),
so the repo history stays the single narrative of what changed and why.

## 2026-07-08 — Redis OOM incident remediation

**Incident**: Redis (shared instance, DB 0 = arc) was OOM-killed 18× between
00:30–01:07 on 2026-07-07. Root cause: no `maxmemory` (=0) with `noeviction`
on a 30.6 GB box with no swap; dataset had grown to ~14.6 GB RSS, ~90% of it
the `library:work:*:text` corpus (29,238 blobs totalling 12.7 GB).

### Redis memory cap (applied 2026-07-08)

```
CONFIG SET maxmemory 17179869184     # 16 GB
CONFIG REWRITE                        # persisted to /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

- Policy stays `noeviction` — deliberate. Arc's dataset is canonical (no
  cache semantics); evicting article hashes silently would be worse than
  failing writes loudly.
- Persistence verified via `CONFIG REWRITE` returning OK (redis 8.0.5 writes
  its own config file as the redis user; the file is not readable by `ross`,
  so verification is the REWRITE return status, not a grep).
- The 16 GB cap is sized for the pre-purge dataset. After the library corpus
  moves to SQLite (same day, see below), steady-state `used_memory` is
  expected around 1.5–2 GB, leaving the cap as a generous backstop.

### Swap (6 GB) — REQUIRES ROOT, run manually

`ross` has no passwordless sudo for these; run as root:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 6G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-swappiness.conf
```

Verify: `free -h` shows 6 GB swap; `grep swapfile /etc/fstab`;
`cat /etc/sysctl.d/99-swappiness.conf`.

Status: **PENDING** — commands prepared 2026-07-08, awaiting a root shell.
(vm.swappiness was 60 at time of writing.)

### Library corpus relocation (Step 3 of same remediation)

`library:work:*` moved from Redis to SQLite at `/mnt/arcdata/library.db`
(cold-archive data, weekly cron, read-mostly — belongs on the archive SSD).
Pre-purge RDB backup: `/mnt/arcdata/redis-pre-library-purge-2026-07-08.rdb`.
